# LSTM-and-GAN-with-TensorFlow(CSCI599 assignments)
Some realizations of LSTM, Vanilla RNN and implications of GAN by TensorFlow
## Problem1
Constructed Vanilla RNN and LSTM on sequential text dataset to do text generation and compared two models' performance. 
## Problme2
• Implemented a Generative Adversarial Network with the network structure by constructing the discriminator and generator, then designed adversarial learning to generate images. 

• Implemented a visualization technique, activation maximization which is a visualization technique to see what a particular neuron has learned, by finding the input that maximizes the activation of that neuron..
